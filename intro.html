    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p> 
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of 
        JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). 
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
        JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design /
         program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. 
         JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language,
          widely used for controlling web page behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". 
        In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. 
        The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language.
         Language constructs, such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and
         try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so).
    </p>
